### Key Projects
We have 5 key projects that we will be developing over the coming months. These 5 projects are:

1. AVATAR
2. BOUNTY
3. MENTOR
4. VERIFIED
5. LENS

Each of these projects will require KIWI to operate. We will release more details on each of these projects shortly, in
the meantime here is a small rundown on each of the projects.

##### AVATAR
Avatar puts you back in control of your online identity! You should be able to access the internet freely without having to give up your personal information. Your unique blockchain address is the key to an internet that you want!

##### BOUNTY
Bounty is a better crowd funding platform that lets you influence what should be developed next. Developing products based on demand.

##### MENTOR
No more managers. Work together and profit together. Mentor is the fairer way of working. No more ‘Bosses’ telling you what to do.


##### VERIFIED
Verified protects your assets at all times. Asset ownership and protection easily managed and secured on the blockchain.

##### LENS
Lens is a new conceptual service that we will be investigating more over the next few months. It is a way for you to be able to
buy directly from advertising that you see in magazines, on billboards etc using crypto.
