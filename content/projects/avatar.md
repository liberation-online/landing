Avatar puts you back in control of your online identity! You should be able to access the internet freely without having to give up your personal information.

### Introduction
In this day in age, it seems everyone knows more about us than we know ourselves. Companies are collecting data about us as much as they can and matching it to our known identities (email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts etc etc).

We should not be complacent about giving out this information as easily as we do now. The data is sold to thousands of companies from around the world. Companies that we know nothing about, know far to much about ourselves.

We need more control over what data we give up and who we give it up to. There are of course many reasons that giving up this data is valid but sometimes not in the way you may think.
For example, a company asking for your date of birth to prove you are older than 18 before viewing a page could just as easily ask the question are you older than 18.
You could confirm this without giving up personal details such as your birthdate (which is used in many fraud and identity thefts).

We are working on a better way&hellip;

#### Personalised Anonymity
The ability to use data related to a user in a way that allows for high levels of relevant personalisation in a manner that
allows the user anonymity if that user chooses to do so. The connected world your way.

Using a combination of:

1. Attributes
  1. Physical
  2. Behavioral
2. Adjusters
3. Influencers
  1. Location
  2. Weather
4. Qualifiers
  1. Rules based on any of the other dimensions (attributes, influencers, adjusters)

*More details on the above will be released with our whitepaper.*

#### Example Scenarios
##### Personalised Preference Site Modifier
Using a combination of a site visitors attributes, adjusters and influencers; the content presented to the visitor will be dynamically generated to better suit their needs.

From as simple as showing where the nearest physical store is to a completely customised experience unique to every visitor which will guarantee a better customer experience and better engagement.

An ecommerce site could automatically show me (as a male) all the male clothing items for sale instead of a generic sale image.

Even better, they could see that I am in London and that it is raining currently and so show me appropriate rainy weather apparel.

I news channel could customise the stories it shows me, if I am not interested in Football, then it would not show me any
football related stories.
